# Sorting and Gaming Project

## Overview

This project combines Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, sorting algorithms, and Windows Forms to create a versatile application. The project includes a sorting module with Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Selection Sort, as well as a gaming arena with interactive character classes like Warrior, Archer, and ArcherCommander.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Sorting Algorithms
- Windows Forms

## Sorting Algorithms

The sorting module incorporates Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Selection Sort on custom data objects, providing a comprehensive demonstration of sorting techniques.

## Gaming Arena

The gaming arena features OOP-based character classes, enabling the creation of Warriors, Archers, and Archer Commanders. The Windows Forms interface facilitates an interactive gaming experience.

## Features

- **Sorting Module:** Implements popular sorting algorithms on custom data objects.
- **Gaming Arena:** Utilizes OOP for diverse character classes and allows interactive gameplay on a Windows Forms application.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file in a C# IDE.
3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

Explore the sorting module and gaming arena to understand OOP principles, sorting algorithms, and Windows Forms development.
